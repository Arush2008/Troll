## 🛠️ Development

### 🏗️ Adding New Troll Features

```javascript
// Create a new troll feature class
class MyCustomTroll extends BaseTrollFeature {
    setup() {
        // Initialize your troll mechanic
        this.initCustomTrolling();
    }
    
    execute() {
        // Main troll logic
        this.playSound('custom');
        this.engine.showNotification('Custom troll activated!', 'virus');
    }
    
    enableAdvancedMode() {
        super.enableAdvancedMode();
        // Advanced trolling behavior
    }
}

// Register with the main engine
trollEngine.registerFeature('customTroll', new MyCustomTroll(trollEngine));
```

### 🔧 Debug Mode

Access the debug console after unlocking developer mode:

```javascript
// Get troll engine instance
const engine = getTrollEngine();

// Check user statistics  
console.log(engine.getSessionData());

// Trigger specific features
engine.getFeature('blueScreen').trigger();

// Modify troll level
engine.trollLevel = 100;

// Enable chaos mode
engine.activateChaosMode();
```

### 🧪 Testing

# Local testing checklist
□ All easter eggs work
□ PWA installs correctly  
□ Offline mode functions
□ Sound system operates
□ Mobile responsiveness
□ All troll features trigger
□ Session persistence works
□ Debug mode accessible
```

## 📊 Analytics & Tracking

### 📈 Built-in Metrics

The system tracks:
- **User Interactions**: Clicks, hovers, keyboard input
- **Troll Effectiveness**: Feature trigger rates, user frustration indicators
- **Session Data**: Time spent, pages visited, return visits
- **Device Info**: Screen size, browser type, mobile vs desktop

### 🎯 Custom Event Tracking

```javascript
// Log custom troll events
trollEngine.logTrollEvent('custom_frustration', {
    level: 'extreme',
    feature: 'moving_button',
    attempts: 15
});

// Access analytics data
const analytics = trollEngine.getSessionData();
console.log('Total troll events:', analytics.featuresTriggered.length);
```
